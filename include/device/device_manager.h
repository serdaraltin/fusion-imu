/**
 * @file device_manager.h
 * @brief Singleton class to manage a list of devices.
 *
 * This class manages a collection of `Device` objects and provides an interface to:
 * - Add a new device
 * - Get a list of all devices
 * - Retrieve a device by its address
 *
 * The class ensures only one instance of the manager exists using the Singleton design pattern.
 * The device list can be accessed or modified using its public methods.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```cpp
 * DeviceManager *manager = DeviceManager::getInstance();
 * manager->addDevice(Device("MPU6050", 0x68));
 * ```
